## External Sensor Integration

### ESP8266 and Ultrasonic Sensor

The CYCL app integrates an ESP8266 microcontroller with an ultrasonic sensor to assist users during the parking phase. This setup helps users avoid obstacles and park the vehicle safely by providing real-time feedback through the app.

#### How It Works

1. **Ultrasonic Sensor Setup**:
   - The ultrasonic sensor is connected to the ESP8266 microcontroller.
   - The sensor measures the distance to the nearest obstacle behind the vehicle.

2. **Data Transmission**:
   - The ESP8266 sends the distance data to Firebase Realtime Database.
   - The data is continuously updated to reflect the current distance.

3. **App Interaction**:
   - The CYCL app retrieves the distance data from Firebase in real-time.
   - The app provides visual and haptic feedback based on the distance:
     - **Visual**: The parking screen displays the distance and changes color as the vehicle gets closer to an obstacle.
     - **Haptic**: The phone vibrates more intensely as the vehicle approaches an obstacle.
